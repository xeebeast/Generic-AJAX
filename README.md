# Generic-AJAX
Writing AJAX for every server call?
Do you still write AJAX function again and again for every server call?
Here is a Generic AJAX with Callback functions for both cases of Success and Failure.

The .blade.php extention shows that it is a blade template file. Dont be afiad if you do not know about the blade template, it is just
a rendering engine for Laravel so feel free to remove .blade. 

ENJOY :)
